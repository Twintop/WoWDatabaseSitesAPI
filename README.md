# WoWHeadXMLExtractor
Pulls data out of the XML feed and makes it usable for other purposes. WHXE extracts data from the XML, the Tooltip HTML for the item (or other object), and from the JSON feeds provided to return as much information as possible.

See WoWHeadItems for an example of how the library works.

Only items are supported presently. Not all attributes of items may be accounted for right now, though most typical values are included.

If you'd like to enhance this library, please send me a message or send me a pull request with your changes. Thanks!
